## Reusable code

* Function != procedure
* when you can write and translate aproblem into a language faster than writing comments and javadoc, then its a clear indicator to rewrite our API to translate or break them further
* document a lot, basically a javadoc would do as bare minimum
* test, test and test without tests your code is wasteful stuff
* class are not evil
* Central design has all its benefits and hard to fathom
	* Design patterns will be embrassed when done and implemented
	  before hand
