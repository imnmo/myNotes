## Reusable code

* Function != procedure
* when you can write and translate into a language so fast then its a good indicator to rewrite our API and translate or break them further
* document a lot basically a javadoc would do as bare minimum
* test, test and test without tests your code is wasteful stuff
* class are not evil
